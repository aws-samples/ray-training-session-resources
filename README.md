# Ray Training Session Resources
A collection of sample code and resources used in the Amazon Distributed Computing Enthusiasts user group's Ray training sessions.

## Session 1 - Ray Basics:
The first training session (conducted 2025-1-24) was an introductory session on what Ray is, who it is for, and how it works.

This code was from a demonstration at the end of the session, designed to provide a simple example of what it would take to transition a simple PyTorch model from pure PyTorch to training with Ray.

Note that this code is designed to be run compeltely locally (to keep the code simple), so you can easily try it out yourself on your local laptop by running the steps below.
